# HMC Truncated Multivariate Gaussian

Modernized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler for generating multivariate truncated Gaussian random variables with general covariance matrices and linear inequality constraints. This fork provides a pure-Python implementation packaged under `hmc_truncated_gaussian`, along with a `pyproject.toml` for direct installation via `pip install git+https://github.com/neverfox/HMC_TruncatedGaussian`.

Based on the original [Matlab code](https://github.com/aripakman/hmc-tmg) by Ari Pakman and the historical Python implementation at <https://github.com/ptuls/HMC_TruncatedGaussian>.
